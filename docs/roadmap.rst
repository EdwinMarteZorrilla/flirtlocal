Roadmap

Things FLIRT will be able to do in the future:

- Use FLIRT with Ouraâ€™s smart ring and other consumer-grade wearable devices
- Use FLIRT with Apple Health to derive meaningful features from long-term data recordings
- Feature generation for additional sensor modalities such as: blood oxygen saturation, blood volume changes, respiration rate, and step counts
